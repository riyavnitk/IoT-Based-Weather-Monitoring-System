# IoT Based Real-Time Weather Monitoring System
This project is based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and is used to monitor the weather in real-time. The system uses the NodeMCU microcontroller to collect the data from the sensors and send it to the cloud. ThingSpeak is used as a cloud server to store the data and shows the changes in the environmental conditions with the help of graphs. 

## Components Required
- NodeMCU
- DHT11 Sensor
- BMP180 Sensor
- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) Sensor
- Breadboard
- Connecting Wires
- LCD Display
- LED

## Software Required
- TinkerCAD (for simulation)
- Arduino IDE (for programming)
- ThingSpeak (for cloud server)
